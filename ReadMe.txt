 Cryptocurrency Price Checker

## Overview

This project is a web application built using Node.js and Express that integrates with the Blockchain API to retrieve and display real-time cryptocurrency market data, specifically focusing on the price of Bitcoin (BTC) against USD. The application uses Axios for making HTTP requests and EJS as the templating engine for rendering dynamic content.

## Objectives

- Integrate a public API to retrieve cryptocurrency market data.
- Use Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Demonstrate client-server communication using Axios.
- Present data in a user-friendly manner using HTML, CSS, and EJS.

## Features

- Fetch current market data for Bitcoin (BTC-USD).
- Display last trade price, 24-hour price change, and 24-hour volume.
- User-friendly interface with basic error handling.

## API Choice

The application utilizes the **Blockchain API**, which provides access to cryptocurrency market data without requiring authentication.

How It Works
Home Route: The home route (/) renders the main page with a button to fetch market data.
Market Data Route: The application sends a GET request to the Blockchain API when the user clicks the button. The data is then rendered on the page.
Data Presentation: The retrieved data is displayed in a user-friendly format, including last trade price and 24-hour market stats.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is in place to notify users of issues during data fetching.
Error Handling
If there is an error in fetching market data, an appropriate message is displayed to the user.
Console logging of errors is implemented for debugging purposes.
Future Improvements
Add more cryptocurrencies to the data fetch options.
Implement user input for selecting different cryptocurrencies.
Enhance the user interface with more advanced styling and features.
